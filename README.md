## Overview
Turtle Game is a 4-level game aimed at teaching the principles of coding and robotics. Users will guide a sea turtle through various challenges, while learning about programming principles in the process.

## Installation
To get started with the Sea Turtle Rescue Game, follow these steps:
1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Marcooos05/Turtle-Game-Python-Project.git
```
2. Navigate to Project Directory
```
cd Turtle-Game-Python-Project
```
3. Open the Project in Spyder IDE:
    - Launch Spyder IDE on your computer.
    - Open the Python script main.py located in the project directory.

## Gameplay
Once the script is open in Spyder IDE, simply run the script by pressing the "Run" button or by using the shortcut (F5). The game will start, and you will be guided through the following steps:

Introduction: An overview of the game objectives and controls.
Level 1: Basic movement and understanding the game.
Level 2: Avoid obstacles while getting Sea Turtle to safety.
Level 3: Introduction to Loops in programming.
Level 4: Final level using loops to guide sea turtle to safety.

## Learning Objectives
By playing the Turtle Game, users will:
- Understand basic programming concepts such as variables, loops, and arrays.
- Develop problem-solving skills through interactive coding challenges.
- Gain introductory knowledge of robotics principles applied in a fun and engaging way.
