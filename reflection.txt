Turtle Game Python Project is my first coding project that I embarked on at SUTD, it was also the first group project with a group of my choice Group Turtle.png. Through this project, I had the opportunity to practice the use of common programming principles within python such as variables, loops and classes. In the development of this simple Turtle Game, I was introduced to Tkinter library, a Graphic User Interface (GUI) for the python interface. Although this was not part of the project requirement, I had an enjoyable experience pushing myself to learn a new library in python. From a technical standpoint, I was able to build on my foundation of python programming and pick up the use of new libraries within python, making this project a challenging yet fruitful and memorable experience.

Apart from the technical knowledge gained, this coding project was also a great reflection for me as a team player. Working in a group with new people had its challenges but I am glad to have had this chance to work with Group Turtle.png. As a team we were able to use our strengths to make the project better, it was a great dynamic where the team was greater than the sum of its parts.
