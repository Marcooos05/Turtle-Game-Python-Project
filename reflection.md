Reflection on My First Coding Project: Turtle Game Python Project

My Turtle Game project was not only my first coding endeavor at SUTD but also my first group project with a team of my choice, Group Turtle.png. This project provided a valuable opportunity to practice fundamental programming principles in Python, such as variables, loops, and classes.

In the development of this simple Turtle Game, I explored the Tkinter library, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit for Python. While learning Tkinter was not a project requirement, I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of tinkering with a new library. This experience allowed me to build on my Python programming foundation and expand my skills with new tools, making the project both challenging and rewarding.

Beyond the technical knowledge, this project was a significant reflection on teamwork. Working with new people presented its challenges, but it was a valuable experience collaborating with Group Turtle.png. Our team dynamic was strong as we leveraged each other's strengths to enhance the project. Teamwork was well demonstrated in that our combined efforts created a result greater than the sum of our individual contributions.

Overall, the Turtle Game project was a memorable and fruitful experience, providing both technical growth and an opportunity to develop my teamwork skills.
